      <description>The four values define core mindset we are working toward:
 EXPLORATION - Exploration and play over tests and perfection; GROWTH - Growth and rework over assessment reports without corresponding mechanisms to improve identified weaknesses; SELF-REGULATION - Student-driven reflection and improvement over teacher directives; and LIFE WORTHY LEARNING - Learning that supports additional learning over detailed course content.  We understand that there is value in many approaches and we don&amp;rsquo;t exclude other values, we just prioritize these over others.</description>

      <description>Here are the following ten practices that we find that help students with engagement and self-regulation:
 EXPLORATION - Exploration over fixed content GROWTH MINDSET - Growth over stasis TRUST - Self-regulation over teacher control TRANSPARENCY - Visibility over obscurity ADAPTABILITY - Flexibility over rigidity SMALLIFY - Quick, workable iterations and feedback over big plans VALUE - Valuable learning over convenient assessments COLLABORATION - Working together over competing against REDO - Reflection and progress over right and done UPLIFT - Problems as opportunity over problems as problems  Each author of this document implements these differently in the classroom, but as practices we all agree they are helpful.</description>

      <description>We aren’t finished, we’re just beginning. We are interested in collecting more updating EDgility.
Of course, as educators, we will keep our own priorities.
