We can do school better by supporting authentic learning.
I hold a PhD in Curriculum &amp;amp; Instruction from the University of Minnesota, a ScrumMaster certification in Agility, and a belief that we all can build on our current practice to create incredible learning organizations.
I attribute much of my innovation in teaching and learning to 20 years of summer camp experience.</description>

Currently working at GaraioREM as a Developer
Full Bio
I hold a Masters in Electrical Engineering and worked as a robotist and researcher. Then I moved into teaching (Math, Computer Science and Physics). Overtime I also worked in IT at schools. Most recently, I have moved into full-time Software Development and also aquired a ScrumMaster certificate.
My technical background has strongly influenced how I teach: research and Agile practices have helped me develop a keen interest in the joy of exploring or â€˜playful experiments.</description>

As a teacher in the UK, I started my career working in diverse and somewhat challenging public schools. I began to question my role as a teacher. Was I really doing it right? Why did I feel like giving up? It was a weird feeling and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like my students were getting the best from me.
Moving to the Alps and teaching here has given me a whole new perspective, not just because of the amazing views, but due to the freedom and professional push my colleagues have given.</description>
