**Teacher, Researcher, Writer**

_Currently works at Leysin American School in Switzerland (LAS)_

[Full Bio](/team/pmagnuson)

We can do school better by supporting authentic learning.

I hold a PhD in Curriculum & Instruction from the University of Minnesota, a ScrumMaster certification in Agility, and a belief that we all can build on our current practice to create incredible learning organizations.

I attribute much of my innovation in teaching and learning to 20 years of summer camp experience. Never underestimate the power of learning when unfettered from school rules! I’ve taught at all age levels and in multiple areas, including world languages, ESL, applied linguistics, and leadership. Since 2008 I’ve held several roles at the Leysin American School (e.g. middle school and summer school leadership, accreditation, and director of professional development and research). I’m a frequent presenter and workshop facilitator.
