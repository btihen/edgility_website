[Full Bio](/team/ncosgrove)

As a teacher in the UK, I started my career working in diverse and somewhat challenging public schools. I began to question my role as a teacher. Was I really doing it right? Why did I feel like giving up? It was a weird feeling and I didn't feel like my students were getting the best from me.

Moving to the Alps and teaching here has given me a whole new perspective, not just because of the amazing views, but due to the freedom and professional push my colleagues have given. I am excited to learn about education again, what makes students tick, and how I can foster learning in a classroom that moves away from the traditional methods we are all so accustomed to.
