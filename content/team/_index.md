# Meet The Authors

We are long-time educators.  Combined we have over 30 years of academic experience.

We meet at Leysin American School (LAS). We felt drawn to take education to the next level -- in particular to encourage students to feel good about themselves, have enthusiasm for school and learning and to take their own initiative to be life-long learners.
