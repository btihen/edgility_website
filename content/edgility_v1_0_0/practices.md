Here are the following ten practices that we find that help students with engagement and self-regulation:

1. **EXPLORATION** - Exploration over fixed content
2. **GROWTH MINDSET** - Growth over stasis
3. **TRUST** - Self-regulation over teacher control
4. **TRANSPARENCY** - Visibility over obscurity
5. **ADAPTABILITY** - Flexibility over rigidity
6. **SMALLIFY** - Quick, workable iterations and feedback over big plans
7. **VALUE** - Valuable learning over convenient assessments
8. **COLLABORATION** - Working together over competing against
9. **REDO** - Reflection and progress over right and done
10. **UPLIFT** - Problems as opportunity over problems as problems

Each author of this document implements these differently in the classroom, but as practices we all agree they are helpful.
