The four values define core mindset we are working toward:

1. **EXPLORATION** - Exploration and play over tests and perfection;
2. **GROWTH** - Growth and rework over assessment reports without corresponding
mechanisms to improve identified weaknesses;
3. **SELF-REGULATION** - Student-driven reflection and improvement over teacher
directives; and
4. **LIFE WORTHY LEARNING** - Learning that supports additional learning over detailed course content.

We understand that there is value in many approaches and we don't exclude other values, we just prioritize these over others.
