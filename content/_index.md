# EDgility for School

We strive to understand learning and its outcomes better, we look for student and teacher growth through self-regulated, collaborative exploration and play.

To focus our efforts we wrote [**EDgility**](/edgility_v1_0_0/), which has four [**values**](/edgility_v1_0_0/values) and ten [**practices**](/edgility_v1_0_0/practices) to guide us.
